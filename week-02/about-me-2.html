        <p>Hello! I am from a western suburb of Chicago called Hinsdale. On campus I a involved in Delta Gamma sorority, the Womens Network, and I work at Telefund!</p>
        <p>Last semester I studied in Florence, Italy. I traveled a lot within Italy which helped me learn more about the country I was living in.</p>
        <p>My favorite city I visited was Amsterdam. I had no idea how much art was in Amsterdam. I visited at least 4 art museums! My favorite was the Van Gogh museum.</p>
        <em> Thanks for checking out my about me page!</em>
