        <p>Hello! I am from a western suburb of Chicago called Hinsdale. On campus I am involved in Delta Gamma sorority, the Womens Network, and I work at Telefund!</p>
        <p>Last semester I studied in Florence, Italy. I traveled a lot within Italy which helped me learn more about the country I was living in.</p>
        <p>I visited:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Venice</li>
            <li>Cinque Terre</li>
            <li>Milan</li>
          </ol>
          <p>I did not visit:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Rome</li>
            <li>Bologna</li>
          </ul>
        <p>My favorite city I visited was Amsterdam. I had no idea how much art was in Amsterdam. I visited at least 4 art museums! My favorite was the Van Gogh museum.</p>
